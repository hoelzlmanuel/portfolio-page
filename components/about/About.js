    <div className="text-lg my-4">

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold">what do i do?</h2>
    <div className="text-lg my-4">
      i like to spend my free time developing - be it a new webpage (like this one), an autonomous robot for a competition or learning how to make the web more secure. i'm not a tech-only guy, however: i also play the piano and am a board member of a non-profit organization i co-founded in november 2018 called <span className="italic">association for technology, research and innovation austria</span> (or atria for short). we founded it with the goal of creating an environment where knowledge can be shared and ideas can be realised.

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold">what am i passionate about?</h2>
    <div className="text-lg my-4">
      i am an enthusiast of combining analytical and creative thinking, and as such, coding is a perfect match for me. when i code, i can creatively think about how all the pieces should fit together and then i can analytically work out what those pieces should exactly be.
      <div className="my-4"/>
      because i am incredibly passionate about this, i am always looking for ways to share what i've learnt and help others achieve their goals. one way i am doing this is through the association i co-founded &mdash; atria &mdash; where we help each other with our projects, host workshops or participate in various competitions &mdash; together.
